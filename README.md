# Minishell


The Minishell is exactly a replica of the Linux Shell, with all the commands for execution, such as "ls", "cd", "grep"
and we perform until the execution with "|" (Pipes), to join the commands, for example:

ls | grep file,

just access the repository and run the MAKE command and then start with ./minishell
